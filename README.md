# FOX 
FOX is based on hunting behavior of Red Fox.<br/>
This is a new metaheuristic algorithm that can be applied to solve different problem.<br/>
<br/>
<b>FOX implementation includes four matlab files:</b><br/>
Get_Functions_details.m<br/>
initialization.m<br/>
FOX.m<br/>
main.m<br/>
<br/>
<b>Get_Functions_details.m:</b> includes the standard benchmark functions<br/>
<b>initialization.m:</b> it is used to initialize the population of red fox<br/>
<b>FOX:</b> includes both exploration and exploitation equation. <br/>
In FOX objective functions are called which is inside Get_Functions_details.m<br/>
<b>main.m</b> file is used to run the FOX algorithm<br/>
<br>
<b>How it works:</b><br/>
You only need to Run the <b>main.m</b> using matlab software<br/>
then you can see the results<br/>
by running the main file FOX runs 30 time ( each time includes 500 iterations)<br/>
Results prints 30 best_Score and then shows the average of them<br/>
all files must be in the same directory.
