# RFSOA 
RFSOA is based on hunting behavior of Red Fox.
This is a new metaheuristic algorithm that can be applied to solve different problem.

RFSOA implementation includes five matlab files:
Get_Functions_details.m
initialization.m
RFSOA.m
main.m
ReadMe.m

Get_Functions_details.m: includes the standard benchmark functions
initialization.m: it is used to initialize the population of red fox
RFSOA: includes both exploration and exploitation equation. In RFSOA objective functions are called which is inside Get_Functions_details.m

How it works:
main.m file is used to run the RFSOA algorithm
then you can see the results
all files must be in the same directory
