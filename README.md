 RFSOA is implemented by Hardi M. Mohammed<br/>

# RFSOA 
RFSOA is based on hunting behavior of Red Fox.<br/>
This is a new metaheuristic algorithm that can be applied to solve different problem.<br/>
<br/>
RFSOA implementation includes five matlab files:<br/>
Get_Functions_details.m<br/>
initialization.m<br/>
RFSOA.m<br/>
main.m<br/>
ReadMe.m<br/>
<br/>
Get_Functions_details.m: includes the standard benchmark functions<br/>
initialization.m: it is used to initialize the population of red fox<br/>
RFSOA: includes both exploration and exploitation equation. <br/>
In RFSOA objective functions are called which is inside Get_Functions_details.m<br/><br/>

<b>How it works:</b><br/>
main.m file is used to run the RFSOA algorithm<br/>
then you can see the results<br/>
all files must be in the same directory.
