%% RFSOA 
% Red Fox in the Snow Optimization Algorithm for Solving Pressure Vessel
% Desing Problem.
% Authors: Hardi M. Mohammed, Tarik A. Rashid.
% RFSOA is implemented by Hardi M. Mohammed
%%

%% RFSOA is based on hunting behavior of Red Fox. 
%This is a new metaheuristic algorithm that can be applied to solve different problem.
% How to Run the code:
% download all the five matlab files and then,
% main.m file is used to run the RFSOA algorithm
% then you can see the results
% all files must be in the same directory
